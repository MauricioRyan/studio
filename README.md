# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

## Creating a new branch

To work on the new features in isolation, create a new branch named `mejorando` using git:

```bash
git checkout -b mejorando
```

This will create a new branch and switch to it. You can then make your changes and commit them to this branch.
